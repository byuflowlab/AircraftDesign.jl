# AircraftDesign.jl
Simple aircraft analysis and design tools for ME 415. Focused on eVTOL this year.

## Getting Started
Our analysis codes use the [Julia](https://julialang.org) as the programming language.  You won't need to know much about the language, but will need to be setup so that you can run the codes.  
- [Install Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) for your platform.  For Windows for you can also use the [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/julia/9njnww8pvkmn#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
- [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) for your platform (a text editor). 
- Install the [Julia extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=julialang.language-julia) (see the Install button).
- Download this repository: click green button labeled Code above then click Download Zip (alternatively if you know git you can clone).  We will be updating the repository with each assignment so you'll need to redownload each time.
